Here are all the tips you need to contribute.

# Basic

## Create Page

In the sidebar, click the `+`  that appears next to the word **Workspace** when hovering over the mouse. A new page will appear. Give it a title and start typing as you would any other document.

## Titles

You can add titles and subtitles in two ways:

- Type `/heading` or `/h1`, `/h2`, ou `/h3` to choose the desired header size.
- Use Markdown shortcuts such as `#`, `##`, e `###`.
    - Create embedded code wrapping text with ``` (or with the shortcut `cmd/ctrl + e`).

## Switch Lists

- Toggle lists optimize your content. Click on the arrow to open.
    - Click the arrow again to hide this content.
    - Create a toggle by typing `/toggle` and pressing `enter`.
    - You can add anything to switches, including images and embeds.

## Callout Blocks

**Notion Tips:** Create a callout block like this one by typing `/call` and pressing `enter`. Useful for adding built-in instructions, warnings, disclaimers and tips. Change the emoji icon by clicking on it

## Code Blocks

You can add code notation to any Notion page:

- Type `/code` and pressing `enter`.
