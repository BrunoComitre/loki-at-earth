# Timeline View

This view allows you to create a timeline for a project. At the moment, the notion limits the free plan to 3 schedules and the team plans to 5. For this reason, I'm not including a schedule view in the main project template to prevent you from getting into trouble. If you are on a plan that limits timelines, you can use this view - just change the Filters to target the intended project. By default, it aims [Mobile App](Projects%208c06dfbe488d429f862029a4c12279a9/Mobile%20App%20434d6a775f344cb29617dd0c578cf8a6.md).

In this view, Daily Tasks are hidden in a toggle to allow the timeline view to have as much horizontal space as possible.

The start is hidden elsewhere in Ultimate tasks, but you can easily show it in any view and use it if you want to add start dates to non-timeline views. Note that tasks without a start date will not be displayed in the timeline unless you have the table view on the left.
