    Add project details directly here, or link to a note with details elsewhere in your workspace. If you use my [Ultimate Note-Taking System template](https://thomasjfrank.com/templates/notion-note-taking-template/), you could easily create a "Projects" notebook, and then add a Relation for it to the Master Task Database! I'll be teaching this concept in detail in my upcoming [Notion course](https://thomasjfrank.com/notioncourse).
