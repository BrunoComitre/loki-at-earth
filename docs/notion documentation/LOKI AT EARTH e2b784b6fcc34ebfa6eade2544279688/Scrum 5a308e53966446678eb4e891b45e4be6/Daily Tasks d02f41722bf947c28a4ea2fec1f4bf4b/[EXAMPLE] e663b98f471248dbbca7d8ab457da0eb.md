I like to make a "daily list" of tasks every day. I look at my task management system, see what's due today and in the near future, and then use that information to create a simple checklist that can also include anything off the top of my head (like small errands otasks that pop up and it's not worth doing full task entries).
This is where I make these daily lists. Each day, I create a new box in this Daily Tasks table and write my tasks. The next day, I move or delete all the tasks that weren't done, then click the Archive checkbox to clear the day from my dashboard.
