# How to Conduct User Survey

**Notion Tips:** This page describes why we conduct user surveys and the processes we follow to ensure that user survey sessions are successful.

# User Research Philosophy

We conduct user research sessions to build empathy for our users and gain insight that will drive feature development.

# Process

## 1. Proposal

If you see an opportunity where user research would substantially help develop a product or feature, start by writing a proposal, creating a new file, and taking notes.

## 2. Find Candidate Users

You can find candidates for user research at [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/).

## 3. Interview Guide

Write an interview guide on file so that anyone doing interviews knows how to conduct the conversation with users.
