**Info:** AThe definition of the idea and surveys of this phase can be found in: [Pre-Development R&D](R&D%2063925d9f526f4661a97608d4373460c7/Pre-Development%20R&D%2027456c38983249dd9575f290799c7d05.md). This documentation below is a summary of the discussion in the cited file.

## **R&D Applied: Research Results**

Below is the documentation of every step performed in **Moments**.

Our R&D phase involved a good research of UX/UI references given the client's business model, studies of UX/UI references, and learning methods that would help us create a fluid user experience that also engages them in the learning process. .

With the result of these researches, we built a prototype, which can be visualized:

> ***COLOCAR LINKS FIGMA***
> 

The intention is to show all the visual references found and present the relevant material that was developed during the searches and studies. But the prototype has already been refined and created following new approaches, described below

Another important point of view is the market's opinion about the future of the solution, which is why we sought to carry out every prototype survey to map the questions and answers made during conversations, in this way we can connect technical knowledge with real-world practice.

It is noteworthy that UX/UI changes occurred, due to business needs. Usage rules were also taken into account to facilitate usage demand. And they can be found in the [Shaping](Shaping%2075640a92a1374809b235f5abc7529459.md) phase of Development.
