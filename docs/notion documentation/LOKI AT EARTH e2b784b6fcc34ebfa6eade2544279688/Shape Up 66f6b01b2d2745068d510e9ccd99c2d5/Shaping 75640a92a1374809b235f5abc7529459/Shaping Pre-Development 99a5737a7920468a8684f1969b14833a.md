# Shaping Pre-Development

Here the project starts to take shape. The objectives of this phase are to define the structure of the project, carry out studies on technology, definition of architecture, definition of business rules, identification and resolution of "black holes".

## **Shaping: Giving the initial shape**

From the definition of studies of the material resulting from the R&D phase, we entered the Shaping phase with the objective of designing the "skeleton" of the project, which has already been created a prototype in the R&D stage.

1° **Breadboarding**

This process is being used as a basis for the concept presented in Shape Up.

We use only 3 elements to compose the structure of the software project we will develop:

- [x]  1. Places: items the user can navigate to: screens, menus, dialogs, among others;
- [x]  2. Features: items that the user can interact with: buttons, fields, texts, among others;
- [x]  3. Connection lines: how resources move the user from place to place.

It was a skipped step already going to prototyping and the real study creating a new layout model. Even so, we were able to identify the components and their connections. This allows us to identify whether a certain sequence of actions solves the problem we are trying to create.

2° **Low fidelity prototype**

It was not addressed, as the idea is relatively simple, the addition of visual contexts did not impact the layout prototype creation time.

Part of the scope of each project, I was thinking about keeping a simple navigation pattern. And done in a tool, which would not be necessary in this part, but as I was a developer only during this stage, it would not impact the team.

3° **High fidelity prototype**

It was created only in the first version of the product, which can be viewed:

> ***COLOCAR APRESENTACAO FIGMA***
> 

After this elaboration, new needs and changes were raised, which do not invalidate the rules created in the prototype above, but they have already been improved and a new prototype was defined and that there was no need to create a high-fidelity prototype since the same in the primary version will follow as a model for others, thus being the high fidelity destined to the Style Guide created within the application.
